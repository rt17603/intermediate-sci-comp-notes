    "### The Anaconda Python distribution and Conda package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is so powerful, because there is an ecosystem of packages that extend the basic functionality (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.). However, these libraries often build on each other, for example code and features within the `pandas` package uses functionality within the `numpy` package. this makes numpy is a *dependency* of pandas and both packages would need to be installed to be able to import and use pandas. In addition, these packages are constantly being updated (creating different *versions*), and each package needs to be compatabile with other versions of other packages meaning it's almost impossible to manage them manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the seminar, we discussed how these packages can be stored together within an *environment*, which can be used by Python to access the right packages and versions we want to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda (Anaconda Individual Edition) is one example of a *distribution* that has been developed, in part, to bundle together the most popular Python packages into an environment, and test them to ensure that the package versions work together (e.g., the version of numpy will depend on an appropriate version of Python, etc.). These distributions typically include a *package manager*, which is a piece of software that keeps track of all the dependencies for each package. For Anaconda, this package manager is called *conda* and, as well as including the most popular packages initially, allows us add more packages to our environment and tries to keep everything working together nicely."
